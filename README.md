🌟 Update from my internship at CognoRise InfoTech🌟

I’ve successfully completed second task of building a countdown timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Here’s a brief summary of what I did:
🔹 HTML: 
Designed the layout with input fields for setting the timer and a display to show the countdown. 
Structured the HTML to facilitate user interactions and display real-time updates.

🔹 CSS: 
Styled the timer with a clean and modern look. 
Ensured responsiveness so that the timer works well on various devices and 
screen sizes.

🔹 JavaScript​: 
Implemented core functionalities for setting and counting down the timer.
Added features for starting, pausing, and resetting the countdown, along with visual updates.
